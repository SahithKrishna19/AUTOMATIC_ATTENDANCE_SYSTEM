# AUTOMATIC_ATTENDANCE_SYSTEM
/*The attendance is taken in all of the organizations. 
Traditional approach for attendance is, professor calls the students name and record the attendance.
For each lecture this is wastage of time. 
To avoid these losses, we are about to use an automatic process which is based on QR code.
In this project approach, we are using the QR code and scanner to scan it.
The first phase is creating a unique QR code for each of the student.
The background code for the QR code directs it to the excel sheet or the spread sheet.
Second phase is extraction of the attendance.
Step by step execution of these techniques helps to achieve the output.
The working of this project is to scan the QR code and mark the attendance for the corresponding scan in the CSV or Excel sheet.
Input of the project is the scanning the QR code and output is to mark the attendance.
Our project is being presented as a solution for the Automatic Attendance System.
The QR code and scanning of the of the QR code proposed to attendance marking in the Excel sheet or CSV file acts as the solution for the Automatic attendance system.*/
